# Asembler Optimisation

Assembly Program for Data Processing

(15) Write an assembly program for data processing. Choose the algorithm from the course page. The program should accept the following command-line arguments: path to the input file, path to the output file, and algorithm parameter values. Provide meaningful default values for all command-line arguments. The program should dynamically allocate pages required for the processed data.

(5) Optimize the program by introducing SSE or AVX parallelism, and document the acceleration.

(5) Write the same program in the C or C++ programming language and test different levels of compiler optimizations. Adhere to fundamental principles of writing efficient code. Compare the performance with the previous implementations and document the results.
